# React Training Workshop

This workshop is not intended for newbies with JavaScript or React, you need to know some basics.  
If this is not your case, please [RTFM](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) before starting.

This training aims to improve your knowledge on React, in particular on modern syntax and the dependency stack that we use at [Pepperbay](https://pepperbay.fr/).

## Prerequisites

- `node --version` >= [LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)
- `yarn --version` >= 2

## About

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and inspired by [scotch.io Code Challenge #14](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/code-challenge-14-test-your-knowledge-of-react-hooks).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
